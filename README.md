# ‚úàÔ∏è **End-to-End Airfare Estimator** 

## üöÄ Project Overview
The **End-to-End Airfare Estimator** is a dynamic flight price prediction system that estimates the price of flight tickets based on various factors such as origin, destination, date, and airline. This project integrates a modern web interface built with **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS**, a machine learning model using **Linear Regression** from **Scikit-Learn**, and an **API** built with **Flask** to serve the predictions. The model has achieved an impressive accuracy of **90%**.
